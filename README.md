# Python unconstrained and unimodal optimization functions

These methods were made for demonstration purposes only.

## Unimodal methods:

- Half elimination method
- Golden section method
- Newton's method

## Unconstrained methods:

- Gradient descent
- Steepest descent (A variant of gradient descent. In this case: uses the golden section method to find the optimal step size between (0;5))
- Nelder-Mead deforming simplex method

### Demo instructions

1. Clone or copy all files in this repository
2. Launch unconstrained_demo.py - graphs will launch in order of gradient descent then steepest descent and finally deforming simplex

*Feel free to go inside unconstrained_demo.py and play around. Though keep in mind that there is a high likelihood of these demo functions breaking*
